A question paper analysis web application based on [bloom's taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/). It currently supports only single format for the question paper.

  - CO (course outcome), wightage of it according to the field of question paper and associated bloom's level of it
  - Number of hours per module
  - Sequence of fields in question paper

      - Title of the field (must be unique)
      - Type of fields (Question, Question number, Sub Question number, Marks, Module, CO)
      - Type of character which represents that field (For question number it can be Q followed by a number ex- Q1)
