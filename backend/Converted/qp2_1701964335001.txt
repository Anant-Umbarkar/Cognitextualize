An-MQ3B)Following data was recorded while determining calorific value of gaseous fuel by 
Boy’s gas calorimeter.
i) Volume of gas burnt at STP = 0.09m3
ii) Mass of water used in time ‘t’ = 24 Kg
iii)Temperature of inlet water = 22 0C
iv) Temperature of outlet  water = 35 0C
v) Mass of steam condensed = 0.03 Kg
Calculate Higher and Lower calorific value.
(Given: Latent heat of condensation of water vapour 587 Kcal/Kg)

CO2Module 5
An-MQ3C)A sample of coal containing 5% hydrogen was tested in Bomb Calorimeter for it’s 
calorific value, following data were recorded. Weight of coal burnt= 0.98gm, Acid 
correction = 55 Cal. Rise in temperature = 2.52 0C, Water equivalent of bomb & 
calorimeter = 550 gm, Weight of water taken in copper calorimeter = 2200 gm     
Latent heat of condensation of steam = 587 cal/gm
Calculate Gross & Net calorific value.
